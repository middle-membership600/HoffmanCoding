# Compressed Sensing Algorithm for Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM)

This repository contains a Python implementation of a compressed sensing algorithm to reconstruct comprehensive grid maps from sparse samples, specifically for data from Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). The primary aim is to exploit the sparse nature of STM samples to facilitate more efficient reconstructions.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- stmpy
- h5py
- scipy
- spgl1
- matplotlib
